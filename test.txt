I spent half year’s savings sailing to see you
For which
I practiced every breath repeatedly
Not a word could carry my feelings about you
I tossed and turned at night thinking about you
Memory is the thing that cannot be erased easily
For what you said
I held tears in my eyes with desperation
At the same corner in an unacquainted city
We once comforted each other
and we signed in each other’s arms
For whatever the result was
I saw you off in a windy day
Couldn’t help weeping sorrowfully
How I expectd to be accompanying you to the end of my life
